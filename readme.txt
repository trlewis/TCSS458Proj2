I tried solving the error in project 1 milestone 2 by reading from the file 
using C++ instructions. As a side effect of that, the inputs in the files must 
have exactly one space between them.

Also templeFrustumV4.txt and templeOrthoV2.txt don't work even when all the
extra spaces are taken out, however when I copy/paste the data into a new file
they work. I think it might be a problem with newlines on Windows vs OS X.
